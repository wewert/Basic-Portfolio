          <img class="resize" src="./assets/images/old_truck.jpg">All thinking occurs within, and across, disciplines and domains of knowledge and experience, yet few students learn how to think well within those domains.  Despite having taken many classes, few are able to think biologically, chemically, geographically, sociologically, anthropologically, historically, artistically, ethically, or philosophically.  Students study literature, but do not think in a literary way as a result.  They study poetry, but do not think poetically.  They do not know how to think like a reader when reading, nor how to think like a writer while writing, nor how to think like a listener while listening.  Consequently they are poor readers, writers, and listeners.  They use words and ideas, but do not know how to think ideas through, and internalize foundational meanings.  They take classes but cannot make connections between the logic of a discipline and what is important in life. Even the best students often have these deficiencies.
